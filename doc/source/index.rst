Overview
========

PI-CRUST is a bioinformatics software package, **currently still in development**, designed to predict metagenome functional content from marker gene (e.g., 16S rRNA) surveys and full genomes.

PI-CRUST is freely available under the GNU-GPL here. However, we are still making changes to various aspects of the software and writing documentation. For now we discourage using PICRUST for general scientific research.
